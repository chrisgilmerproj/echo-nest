Echo + Nest
===

This is a project inspired primarily by the project:

https://github.com/ghballiet/echo-api

I've strung together similar code in python using available
code.  Simply rename `secrets-template.py` to `secrets.py`,
fill it with your credentials and run the code:

```sh
$ python app.py
```

Installation
---

```sh
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
(env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
